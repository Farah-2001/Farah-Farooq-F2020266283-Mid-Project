                        Its official name is Seoul Special City.
                        Seoul is the capital and biggest city in South Korea. It has a population of almost 10 million which is about 1/5 of the Korean population. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It’s considered a megacity because it has a population of over ten million people.
                        Though famous for its skyscraper-filled skyline, South Korea actually has a wonderful, and large, natural landscape.
                        The Guinness Book of World Records lists the Banpo Grand Bridge in Seoul as the world’s largest fountain bridge.

                    <p>
                        Hangzhou is one of China's seven ancient capitals and has been designated a "Historic and Cultural City" by the government.
                        It boasts two World Heritage Sites–West Lake and the Grand Canal.
                        West Lake,the symbol of Hangzhou, is regarded as one of the most beautiful sights in China.
                        At a length of more than 2,000 kilometers, the Grand Canal is the longest canal or artificial river in the world, running from Beijing in the north to Hangzhou in the south.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Hangzhou is the birthplace of Dragon Well (Longjing) tea, which is the most famous green tea in China and ranked as first among China's top 10 teas.
                        The best times to visit Hangzhou are in spring (March–May) and fall (September–November), when outdoor attractions such as lakes, tea plantations, and water towns can be comfortably visited.

                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        Alaska means “The Great Land”. The name comes from the Aleut word Alyeska.
                        Alaska’s flag was designed by a 13-year-old. Benny Benson designed the flag in 1926.
                        Alaska Natives make up 18% of the state’s population
                        Alaska is home to 17 of North America’s tallest mountains
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The northern lights can be seen in Alaska. The aurora borealis (northern lights) can be seen an average of 243 days a year in Fairbanks.    
                        Alaska has the lowest temperature recorded in the U.S. The lowest temperature recorded in Alaska was -80 degrees at Prospect Creek Camp in 1971.
                        About 3% of Alaska is covered by glaciers. If you want to see beautiful blue ice that’s thousands of years old, a trip to Alaska might be the way to go.

                        Around April, famous trees, also known as Sakura, bloom for several weeks with pretty pink flowers that draw visitors from around the world. 
                        The blossoms are known for their delicate, fluttering appearance. 
                        Both the blossoms and the leaves are edible and are used in traditional Japanese sweets and teas.

                    <p>
                        Bern is a federal city, the de facto capital and political seat of Switzerland. 
                        Established in the 12th century, the history of this city has been instrumental in its development. 
                        The medieval architecture of this city gives you a glimpse of Swiss life in the past. 
                       
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Walking by the sandstone buildings, you can get lost admiring the Gothic architecture. 
                        Yet, Bern is not only about manufactured creations, as a large portion of the canton is heavily forested.
                        There are special natural reserves and gardens where you can check out the unique flora and fauna of the region. 
                        Not to mention, the crystal clear Aare river, which flows around this city, adds to the overall charm. 
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bern has given the world some of the most sought-after delicacies, like cheese and chocolate, apart from buildings and nature. 
                        Because of its irresistible charm, Bern continues to be a massively popular tourist attraction in Europe.

                        For most people, seeing the northern lights is a once-in-a-lifetime treat. 
                        Finland is one of the best places in the world for seeing these blazing curtains of light drape across the sky. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Although, at times, the lights can be seen even in the southern most regions of the nation, 
                        the best place to see them is in the region close to or north of the Arctic Circle.
                        Here, between September and March, visitors are almost guaranteed a show if the sky is clear. 
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A wide range of hotels in the north cater specifically to people wanting to see the lights. 
                        Also, the Finnish Meteorological Institute allows you to sign up for free Northern Lights email alerts.

                        Mecca, or in Arabic Makkah is a city in western Saudi Arabia.
                        Because Mecca is a city of Islam, strict laws are enforced and the government of Saudi Arabia forbids all non-Muslims from entering the holy city of Mecca.
                        Mecca is home to, Al-Masjid al-Ḥarām (The Sacred Mosque), also known as the Grand Mosque, the largest mosque in the world.

                    <p>
                        The annual Hajj made to the city of Mecca is the world’s largest human gathering.
                        The Black Stone of Mecca is located on the eastern corner of the Kaaba.
                        The Black Stone was originally white but became black due to absorbing the sins of the pilgrims who have kissed and touched it.
