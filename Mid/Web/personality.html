                    </h1>
                    <p style="padding-top: 2%;">
                        Bill Gates is a technologist, business leader, and philanthropist. 
                         He grew up in Seattle, Washington, with an amazing and supportive family who encouraged his interest in computers at an early age. 
                         He dropped out of college to start Microsoft with his childhood friend Paul Allen. 
                     </p>
                   
                     <p>
                        Today, Bill co-chairs the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation with Melinda French Gates, where he works to give his wealth back to society.
                        Bill grew up in Seattle with his two sisters.
                        His late father, William H. Gates Sr., was a Seattle attorney and one of the co-chairs of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
                        His late mother, Mary Gates, was a schoolteacher, University of Washington regent, and chairwoman of United Way International.
                        Bill has three children.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As the principal founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates is one of the most influential and richest people on the planet. 
                        In recent years he has retired from working full time at Microsoft, and has instead concentrated on working with his charitable foundation “The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.”
                        Bill Gates founded Microsoft in 1976 when he formed a contract with MITS (Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems) to develop a basic operating system for their new microcomputers. 
                        In the early days, Bill Gates would review every line of code. 
                        He was also involved in several aspects of Microsoft’s business such as packing and sending off orders.
                    </p>

                   <p>
                        The big break for Microsoft came in 1980 when IBM approached them for a new BASIC operating system for its new computers. 
                        Microsoft worked hard to sell its operating thus, was able to gain the dominant position of software manufacture just as the personal computer market started to boom. 
                        Since its early dominance, other companies have struggled to displace Microsoft as the dominant provider of computer operating software. 
                        Programs like Microsoft Word and Excel have become the industry standard.

                    </h1>
                    <p style="padding-top: 2%;">
                        Musk was born to a South African father and a Canadian mother. 
                        He displayed an early talent for computers and entrepreneurship. 
                        At age 12 he created a video game and sold it to a computer magazine. In 1988, after obtaining a Canadian passport, 
                        Musk left South Africa because he was unwilling to support apartheid through compulsory military service and because he sought the greater economic opportunities available in the United States.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Elon Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and businessman who founded X.com in 1999 (which later became PayPal), SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003. 
                        In 2005 SpaceX was busy building the Falcon rocket, which he hoped could some day make both space tourism and a colony on the planet Mars realistic goals for humankind.
                        Musk became a multimillionaire in his late 20s when he sold his start-up company, Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers.
                        Elon Musk was a multi-millionaire by the time he reached the age of thirty-one thanks to his creation of the company that became PayPal, the popular money-transfer service for Web consumers. 
                    </p>
                   
                    <p>    
                        Musk has become one of a new breed of what the New York Times called "thrillionaires," or a class of former high-tech entrepreneurs who are using their newfound wealth to help turn science-fiction dreams into reality. 
                        Musk is the founder of Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, a company based in El Segundo, California. 
                        Musk made headlines in May 2012, when SpaceX launched a rocket that would send the first commercial vehicle to the International Space Station. 
                        He bolstered his portfolio with the purchase of SolarCity in 2016 and cemented his standing as a leader of industry by taking on an advisory role in the early days of President Donald Trump's administration.

                    <p>
                        In January 2021, Musk reportedly surpassed Jeff Bezos as the wealthiest man in the world.

                    </h1>
                    <p style="padding-top: 2%;">
                        Morgan Freeman, (born June 1, 1937, Memphis, Tennessee, U.S.), American , director, and narrator actor whose emotional depth, subtle humour, and versatility made him one of the most-respected performers of his generation. 
                        The youngest of five children born to barber Morgan Porterfield Freeman, Sr. and schoolteacher Mayme Edna, Freeman was raised in Chicago and Mississippi in a low-income home. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Not long after he was born, Morgan's parents, like so many other African Americans struggling under the pressures of the Jim Crow South, relocated to Chicago to find work. 
                        They later moved to Tennessee and eventually back to Mississippi, where Mayme Edna settled her family in Greenwood.
                        As a kid, Freeman spent a good portion of his time scraping together enough money to see movies, where he formed an early admiration for actors like Gary Cooper, Spencer Tracy and Sidney Poitier. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It was by chance that Freeman himself got into acting. 
                        Noted for his distinctive deep voice, Freeman is known for his various roles in a wide variety of film genres.
                        He loved acting from childhood and won a state wide drama competition when he was just 12. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Even though acting was always his first love, he was unsure of pursuing it as a career and instead chose to serve as a radar technician in the ‘United States Air Force.’ 
                        But, he soon realized that acting was his true passion and took acting and dancing lessons. He made his acting debut as a stage actor in the touring company version of ‘The Royal Hunt of the Sun.’
                        He got his big break when he was cast in the all African-American Broadway production ‘Hello, Dolly!’ which got his performance noticed. 
                     </p>

                     <p>
                        Gradually, he made his transition into movies, first appearing in a number of minor roles before landing substantial roles. 
                        His movie career took-off in the mid-1980s when the actor was approaching 50. He was often selected to play wise, fatherly characters because of his age and looks. 
                        His amazing performances have earned him several prestigious awards, including ‘Academy Award,’ ‘Screen Actors Guild Award,’ and ‘Golden Globe Award.’

                        He made his first film appearances and was a cast member on Saturday Night Live in the 1980s, but his growing success was marred by years of struggles with drug abuse. 
                        Eventually turning his life around, he earned a resurgence of critical and popular acclaim, and is considered one of Hollywood's A-list actors.

                        Downey was involved in professional acting and drugs consumption from a very young age, owing to his highly creative and addicted father. 
                        He has spent his life in and out of tabloids, rehabilitation centers and prisons and yet, his acting skills and talent has given him the status of one of the most cherished actors.
