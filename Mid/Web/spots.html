                        Hitachi Seaside Park (ひたち海浜公園, Hitachi Kaihin Kōen) 
                        is a spacious park near Mito in Ibaraki Prefecture featuring a variety of green spaces 
                        and seasonal flowers spread out across 350 hectares, as well as an amusement park and several cycling and walking trails.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The park's iconic flower is the blue nemophila, which covers Miharashi Hill in the spring and mimics the color of the sky. 
                        The flowers are usually at their peak from late April to mid May. 
                        Paths crisscross the hill providing views over the Pacific Ocean and the rest of the park. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In fall, the hill is covered by green kokia bushes which slowly turn red as the weather turns cooler. 
                        These autumnal colors are usually best from early to mid October.

                    </h1>

                    <p>
                        Home to some of the world’s whitest sand beaches and azure waters teeming with marine life, Jervis Bay is no doubt one of Australia’s crown jewels.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Jervis Bay’s famous white-sand beaches and clear turquoise waters are amongst the safest and most beautiful in the world. 
                        Coastal, marine and hinterland National Parks offer fantastic bushwalking, cycling tracks, Indigenous culture, camping spots, cliff-top lookouts and maritime heritage.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Jervis Bay is popular for watching dolphins and whales. 
                        The marine park on the South Coast of NSW is a home to bottlenose dolphins, seals, penguins and sea birds. 
                        During the annual whale migration, from May to November, whales visit the sanctuary.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The shoreline is blessed with powdery white beaches and the crystal-clear waters are ideal for scuba diving, snorkelling and swimming. 
                        Day tours depart from Sydney to Jervis Bay or choose from various accommodation options in the area including camping, caravan parks and hotels.

                        Niagara Falls
                    </h1>

                    <p>
                        The fact that we refer to the Falls collectively as “Niagara Falls” leads many to believe that we’re talking about one giant waterfall when, in fact, there are three.
                        Niagara Falls was formed from the same glacial-melt activity that formed the Great Lakes at the end of the last Ice Age, some 12,000 years ago.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Lake Superior, Michigan, Huron and Erie drain into the mighty Niagara River before emptying into Lake Ontario. 
                        Put the five Great Lakes together, and you get the world’s largest freshwater system
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These days, the Falls are capable of generating 4 million kilowatts of electricity, which is enough to supply more than a quarter of all the power used in New York State and in Ontario, Canada!
                        More than 8 million visitors explore Niagara Falls State Park annually, coming from all over the world.

                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        Originally the island was named Pora Pora. This means “firstborn” by the original Polynesian settlers that inhabited the islands. 
                        The first European settlers to visit the island misheard and believed the natives had said Bora Bora, so this is why we call it Bora Bora today!
                        Bora Bora is a tropical island in French Polynesia (more commonly known as Tahiti) which is made up of 118 islands that are divided into five groups. 

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        just 19 km north of Bora Bora, by helicopter or boat, you can take a ride to Tūpai (also called Motu Iti), which is a coral reef formation that looks like a heart!  
                        This magical piece of nature is 11 km in area and is totally gorgeous!
                        Snorkeling and scuba diving is a huge attraction in Bora Bora. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There are hundreds of underwater species that can be seen while out exploring the calm, blue waters around Bora Bora. T
                        here are colourful reef fish, sea turtles, starfish, manta rays and sharks!
